## Session Context

### Project Overview
**Zara Coach** - An adaptive AI coaching app for a 10-year-old daughter with ADHD to develop skills through multimodal interaction.

### User Profile
- **Age:** 10 years old
- **Condition:** ADHD (not autistic)
- **Key Challenges:**
  - Concentration and attention span issues
  - Takes longer to grasp mathematical concepts
  - Struggles with reading comprehension - attention is scattered
  - Blows through punctuation marks (doesn't observe commas or full stops)
  - Needs vocabulary expansion
  - Needs understanding of general world concepts

### App Vision
**Core Concept:** Personal AI learning and improvement system that adapts to strengths and weaknesses

**Interaction Modes:**
1. **Voice** - Vocal practice with the app
2. **Touch** - Interactive input via iPad touchscreen
3. **Photo** - Solve math questions in notebook, photograph solutions for AI review

**Timeline:** Working MVP in 1 week
**Future Goal:** After 1 year of use with daughter, potentially take to market

## Educational Framework Research (Completed)

### Recommended Frameworks

**Universal Design for Learning (UDL)**
- Focus on: Engagement, Representation, Multiple modes of expression

### Critical Strategies for ADHD Learners

**Pacing & Reading:**
- ADHD students often race through text thinking speed = good reading
- Needs explicit training to slow down at punctuation
- Use guided oral reading with skilled reader support

**Multimodal Reinforcement:**
- Visual + Audio + Tactile engagement
- Provides cues in multiple modalities simultaneously

**Chunking:**
- Short bursts of content to maintain focus
- Keep reading passages short initially

**Self-Monitoring:**
- AI can help track attention in 3-5 minute intervals
- Random interval reminders to check attention-to-task
- Helps develop accountability and self-awareness

**Immediate Feedback:**
- Real-time feedback helps students stay on track
- Research shows 62% improvement with AI adaptive systems

**Interest-Based Content:**
- Let learner choose topics to boost engagement
- Higher focus when reading about topics of interest

**Active Reading:**
- Looking for keywords
- Answering questions while reading
- Highlighting key points
- Filling in blanks on worksheets

**Visual Aids:**
- Outlines for reading tasks
- Story maps and diagrams
- Book walks and predictions to activate prior knowledge

### Proven AI Results

**Research Findings:**
- AI-assisted instruction: 17.5% retention increase (24.1% with adaptive models)
- MathSpring AI tutor: Significant improvements in 3 months for grades 4-8 students with math difficulties
- Knewton system: 62% test score improvement
- Pearson correlation (r = 0.81): AI personalization has strongest influence on learning outcomes

**Mathematics-Specific:**
- Step-by-step visual explanations
- Abstract problems become easier to understand
- Students can understand complex topics at their own pace with less frustration

**Vocabulary & Content:**
- Image-based vocabulary
- Predictive sentence formation
- Adaptive feedback based on behavioral cues
- Diffit: AI tool for differentiated reading materials at various levels

**Adaptive System Features:**
- Balance comfort zone and challenge/frustration zone
- Adjust difficulty level dynamically
- Provide alternative explanations
- Present information in various formats (visual, auditory, tactile)
- Offer immediate feedback and reinforcement
